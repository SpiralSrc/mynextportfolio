# Rustic Roots Salon

### About this project

Personally designed business website that perfectly captures the rustic and natural theme of the salon. With a minimalistic approach, the website showcases the services, about the salon, images of their clients, and contact information in a clean and visually appealing layout. The use of earthy tones, natural textures, and high-quality imagery creates a welcoming and serene online experience for visitors. The static website provides a seamless and informative platform for clients to learn about the salon and its offerings, ultimately driving engagement and business growth.
