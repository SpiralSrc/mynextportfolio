# My Startpage

### About this project

A personal fullstack project being used as an everyday startpage. Secured with an authentication using Clerk Auth as an "admin" user that only I am able to add link sources for quick access on websites that I usually visit and MongoDB Compass as my database for storage via Mongoose. There are also options either "Duckduckgo" or "Google Search" as search engines and vanilla javascript for the greetings, date and time.
