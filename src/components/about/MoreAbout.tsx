          I bring a unique perspective to frontend development, having
          transitioned from a career in nursing to the tech industry.
          My background in nursing has equipped me with invaluable
          soft skills that have proven to be incredibly beneficial in
          my journey as a frontend developer. It has instilled in me a
          deep sense of patience and resilience, which have been
          instrumental in tackling complex coding challenges and
          problem-solving in web development.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-7">
          Alongside my technical expertise, I prioritize
          professionalism, empathy, and a strong sense of
          confidentiality in my work. I have a keen eye for detail and
          a strong sense of adaptability, both of which are crucial in
          delivering high-quality and accessible web applications.
        </p>

        <p className="indent-7">
          As a passionate developer, I have also taken the initiative
          to expand my skills into backend development. This has not
          only deepened my understanding of how backend systems work,
          but also equipped me with the knowledge to collaborate more
          effectively with backend teams. I believe that having a
          well-rounded understanding of both frontend and backend
          technologies will greatly enhance my ability to create
          seamless and efficient solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-7">
          Committed to practicing good coding practices, I am
          dedicated to continuously refining my skills and staying
          updated with the latest industry trends and technologies as
          the world of programming is constantly evolving seeking to
          find better solutions or make coding easier.
